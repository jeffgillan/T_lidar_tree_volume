# T_lidar_tree_volume
This is code from 2022 when I was working with Flurin Babst to estimate tree volume from terrestrial lidar scans. The code primarily uses the R package 'Treels'. It can identify individual tree stems and fit cylinders around stems and major branches. For more information about 'TreeLS' see https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/TreeLS/versions/2.0.2
